These use Samsung 67ah prismatic power cells.
You can easily add an 8s Lithium Ion BMS since the balance leads are already connected, simply connect the balance leads to your BMS. The board you see on the front is just a balancer and communication pcb but that part is not a BMS.
They are 8s lithium ion with a 3.8 nominal voltage per cell and 67ah.  Each cell fully charged voltage is 4.2v and fully discharged is 2.8v. 


Max Continuous Charge Rate - 67a
Max Continuous Discharge Rate - 450a (high power)

Model Name: EM2031AE00YA

Dimensions are 16.5" x 9" x 7"
Module Fully charged 33.6v
Module Fully Discharged 22.4v
Main +/- bolt size: M8 x 1.25
Weight 37 lbs

 It is detrimental to the cells to be kept at 98-100% SOC for prolonged periods of time (i.e. more than 10 days). This is why many cells are allowed to discharge to around 95% SOC or less before charging is re-initiated, even while connected to a charger.

4.1 would be 95%
4.0 would be 90%
3.2 would be 10%

Darrell Notes

Bought 2 EA @ $99 EA, and 100A BMS @ 100
Total pack max voltage = 67.2
NEVER EXCEED 67.2V  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Main +/- bolt size: M8 x 1.25

22A * 60.8v nominal  = 1.36 kW  Standard Discharge Power 

Recommended End of Discharge Voltage: 51.2

Pack safe working range = 51.2V to 66V

67V = 4.1875 per cell
66V = 4.125 per cell
65V = 4.06 per cell

Can get waterproof 65-67V 1200W ps from https://www.ebay.com/itm/145045662361?var=444248829251  for $140
